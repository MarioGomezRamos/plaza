abstract = {The protons and neutrons in a nucleus can form strongly correlated nucleon pairs. Scattering experiments, in which a proton is knocked out of the nucleus with high-momentum transfer and high missing momentum, show that in carbon-12 the neutron-proton pairs are nearly 20 times as prevalent as proton-proton pairs and, by inference, neutron-neutron pairs. This difference between the types of pairs is due to the nature of the strong force and has implications for understanding cold dense nuclear systems such as neutron stars.}}

volume={50},
number={1},
pages={8},
abstract={MINOS is a new apparatus dedicated to in-beam nuclear structure experiments with low-intensity exotic beams in inverse kinematics at intermediate energies above 150MeV/nucleon. The device is composed of a thick liquid-hydrogen target coupled to a compact time projection chamber (TPC) serving as a vertex tracker. Either used for in-beam gamma spectroscopy of bound excited states or invariant-mass spectroscopy of unbound states, MINOS aims at improving the luminosity by a very significant factor compared to standard solid-target material experiments while improving experimental resolutions.},

abstract = {Quasi-free scattering reactions of the type (p,2p) were measured for the first time exclusively in complete and inverse kinematics, using a 12C beam at an energy of ∼400 MeV/u as a benchmark. This new technique has been developed to study the single-particle structure of exotic nuclei in experiments with radioactive-ion beams. The outgoing pair of protons and the fragments were measured simultaneously, enabling an unambiguous identification of the reaction channels and a redundant measurement of the kinematic observables. Both valence and deeply-bound nucleon orbits are probed, including those leading to unbound states of the daughter nucleus. Exclusive (p,2p) cross sections of 15.8(18) mb, 1.9(2) mb and 1.5(2) mb to the low-lying 0p-hole states overlapping with the ground state (3/2−) and with the bound excited states of 11B at 2.125 MeV (1/2−) and 5.02 MeV (3/2−), respectively, were determined via γ-ray spectroscopy. Particle-unstable deep-hole states, corresponding to proton removal from the 0s-orbital, were studied via the invariant-mass technique. Cross sections and momentum distributions were extracted and compared to theoretical calculations employing the eikonal formalism. The obtained results are in a good agreement with this theory and with direct-kinematics experiments. The dependence of the proton–proton scattering kinematics on the internal momentum of the struck proton and on its separation energy was investigated for the first time in inverse kinematics employing a large-acceptance measurement.}

abstract={Silicon Tracker for RAdioactive nuclei Studies at SAMURAI Experiments is a new detection system under construction for quasi-free scattering (QFS) measurements at 200--250 MeV/nucleon at the RIBF facility of the RIKEN Nishina Center. It consists of a charged-particle silicon tracker coupled with a dedicated thick liquid hydrogen target (up to 150-mm long) in a compact geometry to fit inside large scintillator or germanium arrays. Its design was optimized for two types of studies using QFS: missing-mass measurements and in-flight prompt {\$}{\$}{\backslash}gamma {\$}{\$}-ray spectroscopy. This article describes (i) the resolution requirements needed to go beyond the sensitivity of existing systems for these two types of measurements, (ii) the conceptual design of the system using detailed simulations of the setup and (iii) its complete technical implementation and challenges. The final tracker aims at a sub-mm reaction vertex resolution and is expected to reach a missing-mass resolution below 2 MeV in {\$}{\$}{\backslash}sigma {\$}{\$}for (p, 2p) reactions when combined with the CsI(Na) CATANA array.},

The outgoing proton-proton and proton-neutron pairs were detected in coincidence with the reaction fragments in kinematically complete measurements. The efficiency to detect these pairs has been obtained from GEANT4 simulations which were tested using the 12C(p,2p) and 12C(p,pn) reactions. Experimental cross sections and momentum distributions have been obtained and compared to DWIA calculations based on eikonal theory. The new results reported here are combined with previously published cross sections for quasi-free scattering from oxygen and nitrogen isotopes and together they enable a systematic study of the reduction of single-particle strength compared to predictions of the shell model over a wide neutron-to-proton asymmetry range. The combined reduction factors show a weak or no dependence on isospin asymmetry, in contrast to the strong dependency reported in nucleon-removal reactions induced by nuclear targets at lower energies. However, the reduction factors for (p,2p) are found to be 'significantly smaller than for (p,pn) reactions for all investigated nuclei.}

Once it starts its operation, it will be the main nuclear physics research facility in many basic sciences and their applications in Europe for the coming decades. Owing to the ability of the new fragment separator, Super-FRagment Separator, to produce high-intensity radioactive ion beams in the energy range up to about 2 GeV/nucleon, these can be used in various nuclear reactions. This opens a unique opportunity for various nuclear structure studies across a range of fields and scales: from low-energy physics via the investigation of multi-neutron systems and halos to high-density nuclear matter and the equation of state, following heavy-ion collisions, fission and study of short-range correlations in nuclei and hypernuclei. The newly developed reactions with relativistic radioactive beams (R3B) set up at FAIR would be the most suitable and versatile for such studies. An overview of highlighted physics cases foreseen at R3B is given, along with possible future opportunities, at FAIR.

abstract = {A new formulation of the theory of nuclear reactions based on the properties of a generalized “optical” potential is presented. The real and imaginary part of this potential satisfy a dispersion type relation while its poles give rise to resonances in nuclear reactions. A new derivation of the Breit-Wigner formula is given in which the concept of channel radius is not employed. This derivation is extended to the case of overlapping resonances. These results can then be employed to obtain the complex potential well model for pure elastic scattering. This potential well is shown to become real as the average width of the resonances increases. Reactions as well as elastic scattering are treated. Considering the former process in an isolated resonance, we obtain a nonresonant term analogous to the familiar potential scattering term of elastic scattering. This is just the direct interaction term which thus appears automatically in this formalism. Upon performing the appropriate energy averages over resonances, the complex potential well model is generalized so as to include inelastic scattering. The effects of the identity of nucleons is investigated. It is shown that our formalism is valid as long as the exit channels can at most contain one nucleon.}

We present a systematic theoretical analysis of these data with the aim of studying the quenching of the single-particle strengths and its binding-energy dependence. For that, the measured semi-inclusive (p,2p) and (p,pn) cross sections are compared with theoretical predictions based on single-particle cross sections derived from a novel coupled-channels formalism and shell-model spectroscopic factors. A systematic reduction of about 20–30% is found, with a very limited dependence on proton–neutron asymmetry.}

abstract = {One-neutron removal (p,pn) reactions induced by two-neutron Borromean nuclei are studied within a Transfer-to-the-Continuum (TC) reaction framework, which incorporates the three-body character of the incident nucleus. The relative energy distribution of the residual unbound two-body subsystem, which is assumed to retain information on the structure of the original three-body projectile, is computed by evaluating the transition amplitude for different neutron-core final states in the continuum. These transition amplitudes depend on the overlaps between the original three-body ground-state wave function and the two-body continuum states populated in the reaction, thus ensuring a consistent description of the incident and final nuclei. By comparing different 11Li three-body models, it is found that the 11Li(p,pn)10Li relative energy spectrum is very sensitive to the position of the p1/2 and s1/2 states in 10Li and to the partial wave content of these configurations within the 11Li ground-state wave function. The possible presence of a low-lying d5/2 resonance is discussed. The coupling of the single particle configurations with the non-zero spin of the 9Li core, which produces a spin-spin splitting of the states, is also studied. Among the considered models, the best agreement with the available data is obtained with a 11Li model that incorporates the actual spin of the core and contains ∼31% of p1/2-wave content in the n-9Li subsystem, in accord with our previous findings for the 11Li(p,d)10Li transfer reaction, and a near-threshold virtual state.}

The weight of the different 10Li configurations in the system's ground state is obtained from the structure calculations unambiguously. The effect of the 9Li spin in the calculated observables is also investigated. We find that, although all the considered models succeed in reproducing the shape of the data, the magnitude is very sensitive to the content of p1/2 wave in the 11Li ground-state wave function. Among the considered models, the best agreement with the data is obtained when the 11Li ground state contains a ∼31% of p1/2 wave in the n–9Li subsystem. Although this model takes into account explicitly the splitting of the 1+ and 2+ resonances due to the coupling of the p1/2 wave to the 3/2− spin of the core, a similar degree of agreement can be achieved with a model in which the 9Li spin is ignored, provided that it contains a similar p-wave content.}

Experimental data for this reaction, measured at two different energies, are analyzed with the same reaction framework and structure models. It is shown that the seemingly different features observed in the measured excitation energy spectra can be understood as due to the different incident energy and angular range covered by the two experiments. The present results support the persistence of the N=7 parity inversion beyond the neutron dripline as well as the splitting of the well-known low-lying p-wave resonance. Furthermore, they provide indirect evidence that most of the ℓ=2 single-particle strength, including possible d5/2 resonances, lies at relatively high excitations energies.}

abstract = {The discrepancy between experimental data and theoretical calculations in one-nucleon removal reactions at intermediate energies (quantified by the so-called “quenching factors”) and its dependence on the isospin asymmetry of the nuclei has been an open problem in nuclear physics for the last fifteen years. In this work, we propose an explanation for this long-standing problem, which relies on the inclusion of the process of core destruction due to its interaction with the removed nucleon. To include this effect, we extend the commonly used eikonal formalism via an effective nucleon density, and apply it to a series of nucleon knockout reactions. The effect of core destruction is found to depend strongly on the binding energy of the removed nucleon, leading to a significant reduction of the cross section for deeply bound nucleons, which reduces the isospin dependence of the “quenching factors”, making them more consistent with the trends found in transfer and (p,pN) reactions.}

The formalism is applied to neutron breakup reactions with a 12C target at 70 MeV per nucleon for the loosely-bound 11Be nucleus and the more deeply-bound 41Ca nucleus, finding a moderate reduction in the cross section for the weakly-bound case and a strong reduction for the more deeply-bound case.

abstract={Nuclear magic numbers correspond to fully occupied energy shells of protons or neutrons inside atomic nuclei. Doubly magic nuclei, with magic numbers for both protons and neutrons, are spherical and extremely rare across the nuclear landscape. Although the sequence of magic numbers is well established for stable nuclei, experimental evidence has revealed modifications for nuclei with a large asymmetry between proton and neutron numbers. Here we provide a spectroscopic study of the doubly magic nucleus 78Ni, which contains fourteen neutrons more than the heaviest stable nickel isotope. We provide direct evidence of its doubly magic nature, which is also predicted by ab initio calculations based on chiral effective-field theory interactions and the quasi-particle random-phase approximation. Our results also indicate the breakdown of the neutron magic number 50 and proton magic number 28 beyond this stronghold, caused by a competing deformed structure. State-of-the-art phenomenological shell-model calculations reproduce this shape coexistence, predicting a rapid transition from spherical to deformed ground states, with 78Ni as the turning point.},

title = {Perey-effect in continuum-discretized coupled-channel description of (d, p) reactions},
journal = {Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics},
abstract = {The Perey effect in two-body channels of (d, p) reactions has been known for a long time. It arises when the nonlocal two-body deuteron-target and/or proton-target problem is approximated by a local one, manifesting itself in a reduction of the scattering channel wave functions in the nuclear interior. However, the (d, p) reaction mechanism requires explicit accounting for three-body dynamics involving the target and the neutron and proton in the deuteron. Treating nonlocality of the nucleon-target interactions within a three-body context requires significant effort and demands going beyond the widely-used adiabatic approximation, which can be done using a continuum-discretized coupled-channel (CDCC) method. However, the inclusion of nonlocal interactions into the CDCC description of (d, p) reactions has not been developed yet. Here, we point out that, similarly to the two-body nonlocal case, nonlocality in a three-body channel can be accounted for by introducing the Perey factors. We explain this procedure and present the first CDCC calculations to our knowledge including the Perey effect.}

ABSTRACT={Scattering of weakly-bound nuclei with a pronounced cluster structure is strongly affected by their breakup. Usually, this mechanism is accounted for in a three-body model with pairwise potentials. The interaction potentials between complex systems are nonlocal due to the existence of excitation channels and antisymmetrization.  However, a common practice is to use   local optical potentials in cluster scattering studies. To assess the validity of replacing nonlocal optical potentials by their local equivalents we  extend  the local equivalent discretised coupled channel (LECDCC) approach proposed by us for deuteron scattering in [Phys. Rev. C98, 011601(R) (2018)] to the case of cluster scattering. We consider the case of $^6$Li+$^{120}$Sn at 27 and 60 MeV and compare the angular distributions and reaction cross sections for elastic and breakup cross sections with those obtained in standard CDCC with local equivalents of nonlocal potentials. We found that while elastic scattering is  not  significantly affected by nonlocality, the breakup observables  could be affected by up to 20$\%$ depending on kinematical conditions of their observation.}}

abstract = {The direct reaction theory widely used to study single-particle spectroscopic strength in nucleon transfer experiments is based on a Hamiltonian with two-nucleon interactions only. We point out that in reactions with a loosely-bound projectile, where clustering and breakup effects are important, an additional three-body force arises due to three-nucleon (3N) interaction between two nucleons belonging to different clusters in the projectile and a target nucleon. We study the effects of this force on nucleon transfer in (d,p) and (d,n) reactions on 56Ni, 48Ca, 26mAl and 24O targets at deuteron incident energies between 4 and 40 MeV/nucleon. Deuteron breakup is treated exactly within a continuum discretized coupled-channel approach. It was found that an additional three-body force can noticeably alter the angular distributions at forward angles, with consequences for spectroscopic factors' studies. Additional study of transfer to 2p continuum in the 25F(p,2p)24O reaction, involving the same overlap function as in the 24O(d,n)25F case, revealed that 3N force affects the (d,n) and (p,2p) reactions in a similar way, increasing the cross sections and decreasing spectroscopic factors, although its influence at the main peak of (p,2p) is weaker. The angle-integrated cross sections are found to be less sensitive to the 3N force contribution, they increase by less than 20%. Including 3N interactions in nucleon removal reactions makes an essential step towards bringing together nuclear structure theory, where 3N force is routinely used, and nuclear direct reaction theory, based on two-nucleon interactions only.}
